A Brief Autobiographical Sketch

by Khenpo Rinpoche Pema Tsewang Lhundrup

I, Pema Tsewang Lhundrup, was born in the Iron-Sheep year of the sixteenth calendrical cycle
(i.e., 1931).

In my eleventh year I took the vows of a novice (śramaṇera) and then in my twenty-eighth year
I took full monastic ordination.

After that, having gradually studied the precepts of a śramaṇera, I received teachings from
Shechen Kongtrul Rinpoche on the Nyingma Kama and Treasury of Precious Revelations (Rinchen
Terdzö) and so on. From the incarnation Namkha Jigme I received The Four Sections of Heart-Essence
(Nyingtik Yabshyi) and more. From Bathur Khen Rinpoche Thupten Chöpel I received
teachings on the Guhyagarbha, Bodhicaryāvatāra and other texts. From Böpa Tulku Dongak Tenpe
Nyima I received such teachings as his commentary on his own Distinguishing the Views
and Tenets and his Oral Transmission of the Invincible Maitreya commentary on Prajñāpāramitā.
From such sublime spiritual friends as Khenpo Tsulga and the supremely learned Dzagyal
Tubbé, I studied various sciences including Sanskrit grammar and logic and epistemology
(pramāṇa). I also studied a great many topics with Khenpo Chökyi Dorje and others from my
own home region. Then, later, I also received a few instructions from Adzom Gyalse Rinpoche.


Now I am 67,[1] and am in the process of pretending to teach others and spread the Dharma.

By the old khenpo, Petse.
